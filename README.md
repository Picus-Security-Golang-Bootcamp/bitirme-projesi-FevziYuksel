# Picus Security Golang Bootcamp Final Project



* Small backend shopping cart application created with Golang which I developed to demonstrate topics I have learned during Picus Security Golang bootcamp.

* Application has 15 tasks and they can be run on Swagger Go client. Application accept request as .CSV file , parameter or json body.

* After starting application copy this address "http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html" to address bar of your prefered internet browser.

* I splitted each task according to their purpose by tagging the corresponding struct.
